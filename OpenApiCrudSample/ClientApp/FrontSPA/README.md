First, we need the `swagger.json` file, which is located in the Swagger folder.
This file is generated by the backend project and is updated with every change made by the backend project.

To generate our services and models, we need to read the information in the `swagger.json` file.
For this purpose, we use the `ng-openapi-gen` library, which can be installed using the following command:
  `npm i ng-openapi-gen`

The necessary information from the swagger.json file is read using the following command and placed in a folder named src/app/api:
  `ng-openapi-gen --input swagger/swagger.json --output src/app/api`

You can also execute the above command using the following command:
  `npm run generate-clients`

Inside the src/app/api/services folder, there is a service named WeatherForecastService.
This service needs to be injected into the desired component and its methods can then be used.
